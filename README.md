This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

---

Let's start by generating a publishable library

`nx generate library sample-types --publishable --importPath=@nguyentamgm/sample-types`

Now we have `sample-types/` library at the root directory

Next, let's build some types from `sample-types/src/schemas/sample-schema.json`
